# Plasmid-Project

Data and R scripts for plasmid network project. 

Main data file is in the form of a phyloseq object (which I use for microbiome analysis but quite useful for working with multi-layered data
Then also the taxonomic information per bacteria, and a phylogenetic tree for the bacteria. 

R script should work as stand alone scripts. Currently one generates two bipartite networks (weighted and presence absence)
one generates two lists of association matrices per bacterial class (weighted and presence absence)
and another scripts generates networks per class, including the stats and figures.

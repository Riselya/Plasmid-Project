# Plasmid-Project

Data and R scripts for plasmid network project. The raw data was downloaded from https://osf.io/ezb8j/ (from Stalder et al. 2020 ISME).

Main data file is in the form of a phyloseq object (which I use for microbiome analysis but quite useful for working with multi-layered data).
Then also the taxonomic information per bacteria, and a phylogenetic tree for the bacteria. 

RMD file might run into errors unless you tweak directories.

The contig processing R processes the raw data from Stalder et al.

Draft MS uploaded.
